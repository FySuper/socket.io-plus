##Socket.Io+

I wanna say  something for Socket.Io+ . i think the Socket.Io is so powerful.. But something error. When i use the Socket developer my project. I had to repeat it some code again. I think, we need a puls of Socket.Io. Let us developer some general project easier than before.

So . What is **puls** ? **+** ?

### what is we used to do ? ###

1. when i first connection the service. we need to provide some information. And get some information from the service.  : socket (information)
2. join . send. exit. list . so. socket.js
3. maybe , i will write my socket.io~
